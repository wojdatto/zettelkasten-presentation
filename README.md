# Zettelkasten presentation

A presentation on Zettelkasten written in Markdown.

## Build

### VS Code

You need to install [marp
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode),
and it enables you to export the presentation using _Export Slide Deck_
command.

However, you need to set `"markdown.marp.breaks": "off"` to render the
presentation correctly.

### marp-cli

To build from CLI, [marp-cli](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli)
needs to be installed (e.g. you can use one of the released [standalone
executables](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli/releases)).

You need to execute export command from the repo root for the [config
file](.marprc.yaml) to be automatically found. Or use a [`--config-file`
option](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli#configuration-file)
instead.

Without the config file, the presentation won't render correctly. I wrap
lines at 72 characters and, by default, marp creates a `<br>` when
breaking a line. The config file turns this off.

To export a PDF:

    marp --pdf src/main.md

HTML export is the default option:

    marp src/main.md

A single HTML file will be created, and unlike PDF images won't be
included in the export. In this presentation, I use GitHub CDN for the
image hosting, so HTML version will display images as long as you have a
connection to the internet.

HTML supports animations for bullet points and a presenter window, so it
might be a better choice.
