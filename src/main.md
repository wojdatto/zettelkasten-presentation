German: *slip box*

Methodology for knowledge development:

* create notes (zettels) with unique IDs
* cross-reference them
* review them regularly

# History of zettelkasten

Similar ideas were around since 16th century, and the first modern card
index was designed in 17th century. Since then, there were many people
who implemented methods that can be referred to as zettelkasten
precursors.

Well-known pre-zettelkasten adopters:

* Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778): 1000 cards  <!-- Karol Linneusz -->
* Jean Paul (1763-1825): 12 000 cards
* Hans Blumenberg (1920–1996): 30 000 cards
* and many others

# Niklas Luhmann

)

*1927–1998*

* German sociologist and extremely prolific writer (400+ publications,
  60+ books)

* he had no research team and no assistants

* > I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am
  > stuck, I do something else.

---

# Luhmann's zettelkasten

* collected 90 000 notes in 27 boxes, each with 2500-3500 notes
* index with ~1200 entries
* ~6 notes per workday

## Approach

* start your day with reading
* simple notes on a sheet paper of the form *on page X see Y*
* at the end of the day write the notes on a card
* every note gets an index number, starting at 1
* at the end, link it to other notes

# Luhmann's zettels

* ID in the top left corner with a special notation
* there's nothing like a topic structure, everything builds from
  bottom-up
* entries are formulated into a line of thought

---

# Folgezettel

* folgezettel is a child to its parent note
* can be understood as a *sequence of notes*
* Luhmann relied heavily on this technique
* but he had to! It helped him to organize his physical zettelkasten

# Why zettelkasten?

* knowledge is ephemeral, so we must protect it from vanishing
* place to store useful information that is easily reachable
* place to preserve information using **our own words**
* connections between notes can create added value

---

# Information vs. knowledge

A wiki is for recording information. A zettelkasten is for recording
knowledge. That’s a crucial difference.

Don’t just write down facts, numbers, and other data. Take the time to
think about what all of that means to you, what conclusions you can draw
from it, and how it fits into your understanding of the world. This is
your zettelkasten.

---

# What is NOT a zettelkasten?

* a frozen set of rules for writing zettels that you have to apply (i.e.
  focusing on techniques rather than **principles**)

* an encyclopedia or a personal wiki (they are tools rather than
  methodologies)

 -->

---

# What is a zettelkasten?

* a method for thinking
* a method for **incremental** reading and writing
* a 'second brain'
* a 'research assistant'

---

# A good zettel

* short, atomic and written in your own words
* refers other similar notes, so you can find connections
* gets updated or extended once your understanding of the behind topic
  changes

---

# Expanding beyond Luhmann's approach

Niklas Luhmann formulated a great workflow that helped him create and
maintain his zettelkasten, but he did it in the time when prevalent
personal computers weren't a thing. We should feel comfortable expanding
his idea of zettelkasten with additional concepts.

---

These include but are not limited to:

* Not maintaining an index, it seems to be a waste of time when we have
  *Ctrl+F*.

* Using `#tags` when writing zettels to easily find similar ones later.
  These are sometimes called *soft links*. This replaces Luhmann's
  categories.

* Using hyperlinks to refer both to other zettels (using relative
  linking), and external resources.

* Attaching binary files to zettels. Different people have different
  needs, but some ideas and thoughts are much easier to express using
  something other than plain text. This can include pictures, diagrams,
  sounds, videos etc.

---

# Approach to hyperlinks

Sometimes we tend to think that a hyperlink is something that can
survive years intact. This is, unfortunately, not true, especially for
more niche web pages.

Probably, the best practice is to keep the actual important information
as a part of a zettel rather than only refer to the external site.

The rule of thumb can be: *a zettel should be valuable on its own*, and
we should treat external references as a source of additional context
and further reading.

---

# Wayback machine

If, from some reason, a webpage is a very important part of a zettel,
and it cannot be changed, we can try to backup it.

Saving the actual page into our ZK is probably an overkill, but there
are different solutions like *Wayback Machine* maintained by Internet
Archive available at <https://archive.org/web/>.

It allows to create a backup of any webpage at its current version.
There is a [handy Chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak)
that allows to create a quick backup or access previous versions of a
given webpage if it was backed up before.

---

# Approach to binary files

There are basically two ways to handle them:

* store binary files directly as a part of zettelkasten
* store them using a different hosting, and link to them

Each of them has its own drawbacks. The issue with the first one is
obvious: we cannot store everything, because the size of ZK would just
explode.

The latter implies relying on some external source. We should ask
ourselves how much we trust that this source will be still available
after 5, 10, 15 or 30 years.

---

# Caveats and traps

Modern technology is very convenient, and, ironically, it might be a
real threat to the zettelkasten. Some features that many people is very
excited about are actually hiding and diluting the cognitive value of
the original approach.

One of the most important part of zettelkasten is the regular review of
your zettels.

* offers search powerful capabilities
* serves as a backup and place to synchronize zettelkasten between
  devices
* access to ZK on mobile devices
